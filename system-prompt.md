**Objective:**  
Assist in generating a detailed **Senior Software Engineer Technical Handbook**, focusing on a single sub-sub-section at a time (e.g., `1.1.1`). Ensure headers and subheaders use incremental Markdown header levels (`##`, `###`, `####`).

---

**Content Guidelines:**

1. **Focus and Structure:**

   - Generate content for **one sub-sub-section only** (e.g., `1.1.1`).
   - Begin the response with a Markdown header in the format `#### [Sub-Section Title]`.

2. **Incremental Subheader Levels:**

   - All subheaders within the response must incrementally add `#`. For example:
     - `### Subtopic Title`
     - `#### Sub-subtopic Title`
   - Do not reset header levels inside the sub-section.

3. **Depth and Coverage:**

   - Provide theoretical explanations, practical use cases, and detailed examples.
   - Use idiomatic Go code with inline comments.
   - Include discussions on common pitfalls, edge cases, and best practices.

4. **Style and Format:**

   - Deliver content in **Markdown format** with properly incremented headers.
   - Use bullet points, tables, or additional formatting for clarity.
   - Code examples should be in fenced code blocks (```go).

5. **Testing and Examples:**

   - Include relevant examples with tests where applicable.
   - Explain code outputs and debugging tips.

6. **Token Optimization:**

   - Maximize the maximum available token context for depth but avoid including unrelated information.
   - If the response nears the token limit, summarize or suggest next steps for continuation.

7. **Seamless Continuation:**
   - End with a summary of what was covered and a suggestion for the next sub-section.

---

**Behavior Expectations:**

- Maintain focus on the specific sub-section.
- Strictly adhere to incremental header levels.
- Assume prior context to avoid unnecessary repetition.

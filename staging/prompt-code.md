## Task: Programming

This prompt is designed to assess your ability to generate production-ready Golang code, write comprehensive unit tests, provide clear explanations, and suggest improvements.

**Scenario:**

You are tasked with designing a concurrent system for processing user requests. This system should be able to handle multiple requests simultaneously without compromising performance or data integrity.

**Requirements:**

1. **Concurrent Request Handling:** Implement a Golang program that can process multiple user requests concurrently.
2. **Data Integrity:** Ensure that data is processed correctly and consistently, even under heavy load.
3. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected situations.
4. **Unit Tests:** Write comprehensive unit tests to verify the functionality of your code.

**Specifics:**

- The system should accept user requests in the form of strings.
- Each request should be processed independently by a separate goroutine.
- Use channels for communication and synchronization between goroutines.
- Implement a mechanism to limit the number of concurrent goroutines to prevent resource exhaustion.
- Provide clear comments explaining your code's logic and design choices.

**Deliverables:**

1. **Golang Code:** A well-structured Golang program implementing the described system.
2. **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive unit tests covering all critical functionalities of your code.
3. **Explanation:** A detailed explanation of your code, including:
   - How concurrency is handled.
   - Data integrity measures implemented.
   - Error handling strategies used.
4. **Improvement Suggestions:** Identify potential areas for improvement in your solution and suggest concrete ways to enhance its performance, scalability, or maintainability.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Functionality:** Does the code correctly implement the specified requirements?
- **Concurrency Handling:** How effectively does the code handle concurrent requests?
- **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
- **Unit Test Coverage:** Do the unit tests comprehensively cover all critical functionalities?
- **Explanation Clarity:** Is the explanation of your code clear, concise, and informative?
- **Improvement Suggestions:** Are the improvement suggestions insightful and actionable?

**Submission Instructions:**

- Name your Golang code as `model_name.go` and your unit tests as `model_name_test.go`.

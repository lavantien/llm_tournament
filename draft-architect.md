I want to make a spreadsheet-like GUI desktop app in the built-in Python Tkinter GUI library and SQLite. To benchmark and conduct tournaments for the LLMs.

- The window size is 1280x1080.
- Each prmopt should have: content, solution, profile, category
- Model Manager: CRUD with models.
- Profile Manager tab: CRUD with sampler profiles.
- Prompt Manager tab: CRUD with prompts. The listing view is collapsable at category level.
- Leaderboard tab: full scrollable table of all models with all their category total scores and overal score. It sortable on every column.
- Click on each row will pop up a detail page for entering attempt and scores and output.

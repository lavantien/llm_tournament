### UI/UX Design Document for Local LLM Playground (LLP)

---

#### **1. Overview**

The Local LLM Playground (LLP) is a lightweight benchmarking tool designed to help users manage LLM stats, benchmark results, and visualize model performance. The primary goal of LLP is to provide a minimal, fast, and intuitive UI for users to manage, evaluate, and compare local LLMs based on various benchmarks.

#### **2. Features & Functional Requirements**

1. **LLM Table**

   - **Description**: Display a sortable table with various LLMs listed. Each row represents a single model.
   - **Columns**:
     - Model Name
     - Type/Version
     - Task Categories (e.g., Programming, General, AGI, Creative Writing)
     - Performance Metrics (e.g., Points, Speed)
     - Export/Copy Output Button (for saving and exporting model results)
   - **Behavior**:
     - Sorting by each column.
     - Dynamic two-way binding for inputs.
     - Clicking a cell opens a detailed panel for further info.
     - Cells can be edited for manual input (e.g., entering prompt responses).
     - Live updates for results, such as calculated scores and performance.

2. **Detailed Panel for Model Stats**

   - **Description**: Each model row in the table has a clickable cell that opens a detailed panel displaying model-specific stats (e.g., performance, prompt details, and evaluation results).
   - **UI Elements**:
     - Tabbed interface within the panel to toggle between different kinds of details (e.g., Output, Stats, Settings).
     - Display additional data such as inference speed, context length, batch size, and task results.
   - **Buttons**:
     - Paste Output: Allows users to paste raw outputs from the LLM.
     - Save Results: Save the data to a specific file or database.

3. **Statistics Page**

   - **Description**: A separate page for presenting charts and graphs that visualize benchmarking data for various models.
   - **Charts & Visualizations**:
     - Points vs. Speed (Scatter plot or bar chart).
     - Task Completion Breakdown (Pie chart or bar chart for different task categories).
     - Historical Performance Trends (Line graph showing performance over time).
     - Comparative Analysis between LLMs (Side-by-side performance comparison).

4. **Export Options**

   - **Description**: Users can export the table of results in markdown or CSV format.
   - **UI Elements**:
     - Export Button on the main table view.
     - Option to export in different formats (Markdown, CSV).
     - Option to export a read-only view for sharing purposes.

5. **Settings Page**

   - **Description**: A settings page for configuring the behavior of the LLM Playground.
   - **UI Elements**:
     - Options for adjusting table display (e.g., show/hide columns, sorting preferences).
     - Global configuration for model parameters (e.g., batch size, context length).
     - Interface to connect to or configure LLM engines (e.g., LM Studio, KoboldCPP, Ollama).

6. **Unit Testing and Integration**
   - **Description**: Full unit tests for backend functionality and integration with the frontend to ensure the application works as expected.
   - **Behavior**:
     - Run automated tests from within the app to validate model outputs and ensure accuracy.
     - Integration test scripts to validate the flow of data between backend and frontend.

#### **3. User Flow**

1. **Landing Page**
   - The landing page will display a summary of available models with basic information (model name, type, latest score).
   - The user can click on any model to see detailed statistics or view/export results.
2. **Model Details Page**
   - Upon selecting a model, the user will be taken to a detailed view showing information about that particular model's stats.
   - The user can interact with the detailed view (copy/paste results, adjust scores).
3. **Statistics Page**

   - The user can access the statistics page to visualize data trends and compare performance across models.

4. **Settings**
   - The settings page will allow users to configure default parameters, such as the number of results displayed or model-specific configurations.
5. **Export Results**
   - From the main view or a modelâ€™s detailed page, users can export the results as markdown or CSV files.

#### **4. UI Design Elements**

1. **Table**
   - **Columns**: Simple table with rows for each model, columns for stats, and action buttons.
   - **Row Height**: Adaptable based on the content (auto-expandable).
   - **Action Buttons**: Inline buttons within the table (e.g., "Paste Output", "Save", "Export").
2. **Detailed Stats Panel**
   - A floating or slide-over panel that opens upon clicking a table cell.
   - Contains tabs for different categories of information (e.g., "Stats", "Model Outputs", "Performance Metrics").
   - **Interactive Elements**: Input fields, buttons for saving or copying data.
3. **Charts & Graphs**
   - Visual representations of benchmarks, trends, and comparisons (using Fyne's available graphing components or external libraries).
4. **Export Dialog**
   - A simple modal dialog to select the format for export (Markdown, CSV).

#### **5. Layout Design**

- **Main Window**:

  - Display a table of models.
  - Sidebar navigation to access different pages (Model List, Statistics, Settings).
  - Top header with basic app information and quick access buttons (e.g., Export, Settings).

- **Responsive Design**:
  - The UI should adjust for different screen sizes, with the table becoming scrollable and collapsible on smaller devices.

---

#### **6. Performance Considerations**

- **Lightweight and Minimal**:
  - The app should remain as lightweight as possible to not interfere with running LLMs.
  - Minimal resource consumption with fast UI rendering (especially important for the table with live updates).
- **Asynchronous Operations**:
  - Background tasks (e.g., model evaluations, chart rendering) should be offloaded to keep the UI responsive.
  - Ensure that table updates, model evaluations, and data exports do not block the main thread.

#### **7. Technical Specifications**

- **Tech Stack**:

  - **Backend**: Golang 1.23.
  - **Frontend**: Fyne v2 GUI Toolkit for creating the user interface.
  - **Database**: SQLite 3.47 for storing model statistics and outputs.
  - **Charts**: Use Fyne's native charting components or integrate a third-party library for advanced visualizations.

- **Interactivity**:
  - Use Fyne's two-way binding to automatically update the table and model stats.
  - Buttons for exporting, saving, or interacting with the model details.

#### **8. Usability Testing**

- **User Feedback**: Conduct usability tests with users who frequently work with LLMs or run benchmarks to identify pain points and ensure that the app remains intuitive and fast.
- **Performance Testing**: Test the app under heavy load (large number of models and frequent updates) to ensure the UI performs efficiently without lag.

#### **9. Conclusion**

This UI/UX design document outlines the structure and functionality for the Local LLM Playground (LLP) application. The goal is to provide a fast, lightweight, and user-friendly interface for benchmarking and managing local LLMs, ensuring that users can easily manage model stats, run evaluations, and analyze results in a seamless manner.

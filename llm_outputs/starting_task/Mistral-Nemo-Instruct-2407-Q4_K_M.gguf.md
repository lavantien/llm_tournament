I'm capable of understanding and generating code in various programming languages, including Go (Golang). I can also create detailed technical documentation following the guidelines you've provided. Here's how I would continue with the `1.1.1.1 Primitive Types` sub-section:

####### Examples

- **Integer declaration and initialization:**

```go
// Declare an integer variable without initializing it.
var x int

// Initialize the variable to a value.
x = 42

// Or, declare and initialize in one line.
y := 100
```

- **Integer types with different sizes:**

Go provides several integer types that differ in size and range. Here are some examples:

| Type                       | Size (bytes) | Range                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `int8`                     | 1            | -128 to 127                                             |
| `int16`                    | 2            | -32,768 to 32,767                                       |
| `int32`                    | 4            | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647                         |
| `int64`                    | 8            | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |
| `uint8` (alias for `byte`) | 1            | 0 to 255                                                |
| `uint16`                   | 2            | 0 to 65,535                                             |
| `uint32`                   | 4            | 0 to 4,294,967,295                                      |
| `uint64`                   | 8            | 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615                         |

- **Integer operations:**

```go
// Addition
result := x + y

// Subtraction
diff := x - y

// Multiplication
product := x * y

// Division (results in float64)
quotient := float64(x) / float64(y)

// Remainder (results in int)
remainder := x % y
```

####### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- Be aware of the size of integer types to avoid overflows.
- Use `uint` or `int` for most integer operations, as they are more efficient than their byte-sized counterparts (`int8`, `uint8`, etc.).
- Prefer using `float64` for decimal numbers to maintain precision.

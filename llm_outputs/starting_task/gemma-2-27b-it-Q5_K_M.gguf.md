I am designed to be helpful and informative when it comes to both programming and technical documentation. Here's a breakdown of my capabilities:

**Programming:**

- **Code Generation:** I can generate code in multiple programming languages, including Go (as you requested), Python, JavaScript, C++, and more. This includes writing functions, classes, algorithms, and even small programs based on your instructions.
- **Code Explanation:** I can analyze existing code and provide explanations of how it works, breaking down complex logic into understandable steps.
- **Code Debugging:** While I can't execute code directly, I can help identify potential errors or bugs by analyzing syntax and logic. I can also suggest possible solutions based on common programming patterns and best practices.

**Technical Documentation:**

- **Content Creation:** I can generate comprehensive technical documentation, including:
  - API references
  - Tutorials and how-to guides
  - Conceptual overviews
  - Troubleshooting guides
- **Structure and Formatting:** I understand Markdown syntax and can structure your documentation with headings, lists, code blocks, tables, and other formatting elements.
- **Style and Tone:** I can adapt my writing style to match the target audience (e.g., beginners vs. experienced developers) and maintain a consistent tone throughout the document.

**Limitations:**

- **Execution:** I cannot execute code or interact with external systems. My knowledge is based on the data I was trained on, not real-time information.
- **Domain Expertise:** While I have broad knowledge, I am not an expert in every programming language or technology. For highly specialized topics, consulting with a human expert may be necessary.

**How We Can Work Together:**

Think of me as your technical writing assistant. Provide me with clear instructions, code snippets, and target audience information, and I will help you create high-quality documentation.

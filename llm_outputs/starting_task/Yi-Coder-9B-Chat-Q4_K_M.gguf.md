As an AI model, I am capable of generating detailed technical documentation on various topics related to programming. My capabilities include:

1. Understanding different programming concepts and languages: I can understand the basics of many popular programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, Go, Ruby, etc.
2. Writing technical documentation: I can draft detailed explanations, practical use cases, and examples for each sub-section based on the guidelines provided.
3. Incremental header levels: I can generate content with properly incremented Markdown headers to ensure a clear structure and hierarchy in your documentation.
4. Code examples: I can provide code snippets in fenced code blocks (```go), idiomatic Go code with inline comments for better understanding.
5. Testing: I can include relevant examples with tests where applicable and explain the code outputs and debugging tips.
6. Seamless continuation: I can end my content with a summary of what was covered and suggest the next sub-section.
7. Token optimization: I will adhere to the 32k token context for depth but avoid including unrelated information, summarizing or suggesting next steps if the response nears the token limit.
8. Focused content generation: I can generate content for a specific sub-section as requested and strictly adhere to incremental header levels within that section.

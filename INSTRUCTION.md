For effectively handle this project, you should:

1. Break down the development into smaller chunks like:
   - Database schema implementation
   - Basic CRUD operations
   - UI components
   - State management
   - Business logic
2. Start with the database and backend first since they're more structured
3. Use the preliminary design doc as the initial context
4. Have clear test cases ready for each component
5. Review and test each generated component, make sure the project is runable after each step, before moving to the next
